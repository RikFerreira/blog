In the last 50 years, factors such as its consolidation as a regional center and the intensification of the real estate market contributed to a fast and unequal spread of its urban space. In this regard, this paper has the objective of measure the distribution of the public schools in the city of Montes Claros as well as the demand for this service. Therefore, this study  works  with  the hypothesis that the offer of the public schooling service becomes more insufficient as it move away from the town center. This reserach relied on quantitative methods for the  data extraction and transformation of the aggregated variables to the urban planning region, and worked with secondary fonts for the contextualization of the results, which demonstrate the high concentration of schools in a few regions that polarizes the rest.","tags":["R","GIS","Education"],"title":"Spatial analysis of the public primary and secondary education access in Montes Claros/MG","type":"publication"}]
